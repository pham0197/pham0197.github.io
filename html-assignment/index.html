        <p>
            Hello, I am from Vietnam. My first name is Loan and middle name is Thanh. In Vietnamese, Thanh Loan is a bird which is the image of a sage, of goodness; it is a symbol of virtue and loyalty in love. Like the Dragon and Phoenix, Thanh Loan is also a divine bird that only exists in legends. However, in Canada or any countries, which use English as motherlanguage, the word "Loan" has a very different meaning, I know it's wierd for anyone who see this name for the first time. It seems like I carry a lot of debts for the whole life. It's just my funny thought.

            This is the 4<sup>th</sup> month that I have been in Canada, and I still cannot deal with the winter's weather. I apply for <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program in Winter 2025. So far so good! In this program, I have learnt 6 subjects but I am interested in these 3 subjects such as Coding, Graphic Design and Photography. They brings various design tools, techniques and knowledges which are useful for working environment in the future. Also, I believe that great design has the power to not just communicate but to inspire and move people.
